### PHP website to collect the Pokemon!

Under this assignment, you will make the table to list the popular pokemon details

### Rules
- Must FORK this repo to your own github, make some changes and push to your own repo.
- The table must include the following information:
  ```code
  Image -> Use the image of type : thumbnail
  _____
  Name
  _____
  Species (for bonus round: All letter must be UPPERCASE) 
  _____
  Description
  _____

  Action -> render the Collect button here
  ```

- Must use the Black theme table design
- *(for bonus round)* Use atleast 3 icons in the website.
  I have already setup the `font icons` in the code. You can use the icons by simply using the following code.
  ```js
  // example of sign in icons
  <i class="fa fa-sign-in"></i>
  <i class="fa fa-<YOUR_ICONS_NAME_HERE>"></i>
  ```

  Please find the icons name under this URL : https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/
